# Laravel Chirper - Learning Project

A microblogging application built while learning Laravel through the official Laravel Bootcamp.

## 📖 About This Project

Chirper is a Twitter-like microblogging platform where users can post short messages called "chirps." This project was built following the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/) course as my introduction to Laravel framework.
